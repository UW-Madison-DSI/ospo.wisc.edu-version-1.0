<h1 class="uw-mini-bar">The OSPO Survey Results Are In!</h1>

<p>Thanks to a grant from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, The University of Wisconsin–Madison Open Source Program Office (OSPO) is positioned to support and grow our vibrant open source ecosystem. The OSPO’s mission is to collaborate with key stakeholders and community members to provide open source learning opportunities, promote best practices, facilitate the use of open source software in research, and make open source–fueled connections between practitioners and adopters on campus and beyond.
This past spring of 2024, we distributed an open source survey to gauge the usage of open source tools among members of the university community, identify open source projects under development, and to collect feedback on improving the open source environment at UW-Madison.</p>

<p>We thank those who responded to the survey for their role in developing the picture of open source on campus. <a href="https://uw-madison-dsi.github.io/open_source_survey_results/">Click to view the survey results, and what we learned about our open source community.</a></p>
