    <h1>Our Mission</h1>
	<p>The Open Source Program Office at UW-Madison will catalyze institutional change to foster the open-source community here and facilitate change at other universities as well. We will nurture the seeds of open-source projects already happening on campus, raise awareness of the role of open-source, build connections with partner organizations like Madison College and UW-Extension, and take action to improve diversity, equity, and inclusion in open-source. </p>

	<h1>Our Role</h1>
	<p>Universities are engines of innovation and productivity in the world. They both leverage and contribute to technology through their educational, research, and outreach activities. The way that various technological products are disseminated and shared is a fundamental issue that greatly shapes their use and impact. The move to open science, open access, and open source is a key strategy for streamlining the use of these products, fostering collaboration, and accelerating progress. </p>
